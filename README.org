** Introduction

   Playwright.el provides an Emacs interface for the Playwright testing framework, allowing users to run and interact with Playwright tests directly from Emacs. It supports various Playwright commands and offers a convenient popup interface using transient for selecting and executing these commands.

** Installation

*** Dependencies

    - Ensure you have Playwright installed in your project or globally. You can install it using npm:
      #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      npm i -D @playwright/test
      #+END_SRC
    - Emacs version 29.1 or later is required as it's all I've tested it on.

*** Manual Installation

    To install Playwright.el manually, clone the repository and add the following to your Emacs configuration:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/playwright.el")
      (require 'playwright)
    #+END_SRC

    Replace "/path/to/playwright.el" with the actual path to the downloaded directory.

*** Using Package Managers

    Playwright.el is not yet available on MELPA or other package repositories. Future releases aim to support this.

** Usage

   The package offers several commands which can be accessed through a popup menu. Use the shortcut ~C-c t p~ to open the Playwright command popup. Available commands include:

   - Run All Tests: Executes all Playwright tests.
   - Run Single Test File: Prompts for a test file and runs it.
   - Run Tests in Headed Mode: Executes tests in headed browsers.
   - Run Tests with UI Mode: Runs tests in interactive UI mode.
   - Run Tests with Debug Mode: Executes tests in debug mode with Playwright Inspector.
   - Additional options: Allows running tests with specific flags and arguments such as --project, --workers, and custom flags.

   Each command opens the output in a separate Emacs buffer, allowing you to view test results directly within Emacs.

** Configuration

   Currently, Playwright.el does not require additional configuration. Future versions may include customizable variables to enhance user experience.
